# Predicting next word approach



The main idea here is to build step-by-step guideline to work with NLP to predict next words.

In the notebook the user can follow the steps since obtaining data to create a minimal application to test the model interactively.

Then, the main aim here is obtain a minimal model able to predict the next word based on typing words.



As result, it's expected:

- Create a step by step guideline for basic NLP research;
- Comparing different models;
- Getting the best model;
- Define a function to test the model interactively.



The PredictWord.ipynb file will generate/save a tokenizer.pkl file and "model".h5 files for each model. This last file is named as nextword0.h5 for the first model, nextword1.h5 for the second one, and so on.
